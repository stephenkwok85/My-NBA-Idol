# My-NBA-Idol
This is my first website/project coded after learning HTML. I am a beginner in HTML language and will be learning more about HTML and CSS to customize and enhance my future projects.

Reminder: I use little to no CSS! This website is mainly to show what I gathered from learning HTML. I only used simple ones to make my website look better and help me fix issues with my HTML code (such as centering, font size, etc.)

Credits to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE for teaching me HTML and for some "template" for my website.
- I used some of his CSS code to start my website (mainly to make it look better)
- Here is a link to his github: https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course
